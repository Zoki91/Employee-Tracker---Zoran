# SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker - Zoran

AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases.

These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).
Our assignment this week was to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL
